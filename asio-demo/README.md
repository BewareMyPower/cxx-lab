## Requirements
- A C++ compiler that supports C++14
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) >= 3.1
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) >= 1.69

## Configure and Run

Run

```bash
./configure.sh
```

to create a subdirectory `_builds` and generate CMake cached files under this directory.

Once the `_builds` directory is created, it only needs to run

```bash
./build.sh
```

to build the executables under the directory.
